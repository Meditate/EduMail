== EdueMail approving system

Code refactoring comming soon...

Hallo!

This is our project, which we made with Punkbooster.

Gems which we used:

* gem 'haml'
* gem 'devise', '~> 3.4.1'
* gem 'bootstrap-sass'
* gem 'simple_form'
* gem 'figaro'

Universities can use our app for approving the university mail adresses. 

How to register your edumail:

* 1.Register
* 2.Send new request
* 3.Wait till admin approve your request
